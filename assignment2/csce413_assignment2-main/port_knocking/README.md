## Port Knocking Starter Template

This directory is a starter template for the port knocking portion of the assignment.

### What you need to implement
- Pick a protected service/port (default is 2222).
- Define a knock sequence (e.g., 1234, 5678, 9012).
- Implement a server that listens for knocks and validates the sequence.
- Open the protected port only after a valid sequence.
- Add timing constraints and reset on incorrect sequences.
- Implement a client to send the knock sequence.

### Getting started
1. Implement your server logic in `knock_server.py`.
2. Implement your client logic in `knock_client.py`.
3. Update `demo.sh` to demonstrate your flow.
4. Run from the repo root with `docker compose up port_knocking`.

### Example usage
```bash
python3 knock_client.py --target 172.20.0.40 --sequence 1234,5678,9012
```
